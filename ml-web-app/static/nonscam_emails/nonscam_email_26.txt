Hi Katherine,

I reached out a while ago about an exciting role with Dev10 and wanted to follow up! Dev10 is looking for talented individuals who want to start their career in tech for their Entry Level Software Developer role and you are a great fit!

Did you realize too late in your degree program that you wished you had pursued technology?
Do you wish you could pivot into tech from your current job or career path?
Did a friend or family member suggest tech might be a field for you but are unsure where to start or how you would break into it?
Dev10 was created to provide an opportunity for those who want to break into the technology industry as Software Developers but lack the skills or experience to get there on their own. They believe in the unlimited potential of people, and most importantly, the unlimited potential in YOU!

If you're ready to finally break into Tech and get your dream job this is the opportunity for you! Hit the Yes! Interested button and sign up, then Iâ€™ll work on getting you introduced to one of their recruiters.
