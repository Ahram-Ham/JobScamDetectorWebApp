Hope you are having a lovely week!

I am reaching out about two roles that I thought you may want to hear about. You're a match with UnitedHealth Group (UHG) for their Sales Programs! There are two opportunities that you would be a great fit for:

Sales Full Time Program
Sales Support Rotational Program
About the roles & why you're a good fit for both:

UnitedHealth Group serves over 85 million people, is #5 on the Fortune 500, and one of the largest and most influential companies in the world serving everything from insurance to health services.

Sales Full Time Program:

You'll participate in a sales development program that will accelerate your career with a company that will help you learn new skills and foster your continued growth. You'll collaborate with experienced professionals, mentors, and sales leaders and build relationships within a close-knit community of peers involved in the development program to expand your network.
