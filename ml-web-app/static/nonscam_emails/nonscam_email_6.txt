Hey Samuel!

Thank you so much for your interest in the Operations Specialist position at Bouldering Project - Tempe. I have really enjoyed getting to know you more over the last few weeks, and I was impressed by your experience and passion for the industry. I truly believe that you would be an excellent fit for this role and would love to offer you a position on our Operations team!

The starting wage for this position is $15 per hour, with opportunities for advancement as our company continues to grow in this market, as well as around the country. As you know, our facility is currently under construction, so we do not have an exact start date for this role. However, I will keep in touch in the coming weeks to keep you as informed as possible about a potential start date and will provide you with at least 2 weeks' notice before then.

Thank you again for your time and effort during the interview process. If you are interested in accepting this position, please let me know as soon as possible. We're excited about the possibility of working with you at Bouldering Project - Tempe!

All the best,
