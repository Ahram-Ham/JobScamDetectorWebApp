Hello,

There's an ongoing survey recruitment exercise for part-time or full-time survey takers. You're paid to shop and evaluate stores and businesses around you. You get to make up to $300 weekly. You'll evaluate and comment on customer service rendered. It also doubles as a great 2nd job and does not affect your present employment or studies. I tried it and I made cool cash. For more details and Description views the attached file.

Best Regards
