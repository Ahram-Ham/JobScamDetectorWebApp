I am Annette Bonner, my specializations are foot and ankle, athletic injuries, shoulder and elbow, trauma and fractures, sports medicine, and arthroscopic surgery. Also interested in procedures of replacing shoulders and knees.

This message was sent to your email because you have an opportunity from the University Office for Students with Disabilities to work with me to help and assist students with disabilities frustrated with ignorance and lack of services but as my interim personal assistant. I can assure you this employment is very simple, all you need to do are purchase some items when needed, mailing of letters, and making payments at Walmart and this employment won't take much of your time at least two hours daily and three times in a week for ($450).

I am unable to meet up with you for an interview since I am away currently helping the disabled students in Australia, for all the purchases and tasks to get done on my behalf while I am still away, you will be paid in advance. Upon my arrival we will discuss the possibility of making this a long-term employment that if you do really impress me with your services while I am away. My arrival is scheduled for the end of January 2021.

To Apply : Please forward all applications including Full name, Address, Alternate email (different from school email) and mobile number Attached Resume( Its okay if you do not have resume to attach). Please its highly important that you reply and send above information to my personal email address(boseannette85@*****.***) so i can respond back to you ASAP.

Best Regards

Professor Annette Bonner
